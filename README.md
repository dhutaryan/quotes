# Quotes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

## Installation

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
There is no any external libraries. Only pure angular, only hardcore ðŸ¤Ÿ.

## Description

You can find two pages. On the first one you can see random quote, on the second one - a list of quotes with search by author and pagination. Author name should include a full name (backend works so).

The latest features of Angular were used (like signals, new control flow). As it's a small app, it was unecessary to use any other external libraries.

## Potential improvements

- implementation of a state manager might help making the code cleaner and declarative

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
